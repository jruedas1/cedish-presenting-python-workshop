1,TOUCH,cold,"We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.",52,348
1,TOUCH,cold,"Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.”",3082,3510
1,TOUCH,cold,"The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.",3683,3990
1,TOUCH,tremble,"And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack.",5856,5953
1,TOUCH,feel,but first—” He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing.,9937,10052

1,TOUCH,feel,"I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.",10095,10297
1,TOUCH,sensation,"I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.",10095,10297
2,TOUCH,feel,"The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather _out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.",162,438
2,TOUCH,hold,"“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.” “For shame!",438,501
2,TOUCH,hold,"“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.",1439,1677
2,TOUCH,chill,"This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be so seldom entered.",4517,4681
2,TOUCH,cold,"All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers.",6018,6480
2,TOUCH,cold,"I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank.",10060,10240
2,TOUCH,feel,"This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm.",12345,12487
2,TOUCH,hold,"I had now got hold of Bessie’s hand, and she did not snatch it from me.",13754,13827
2,TOUCH,feel,"This violence is all most repulsive:” and so, no doubt, she felt it.",14842,14910
3,TOUCH,handle,"Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.",353,531
3,TOUCH,feel,"I rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.",532,593
3,TOUCH,feel,"I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.",903,1108
3,TOUCH,feel,"Having given some further directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.",1713,2032
3,TOUCH,feel,"“Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?” asked Bessie, rather softly.",2032,2106
3,TOUCH,feel,"For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can feel.",3396,3554
3,TOUCH,feel,No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to this day.,3554,3709
3,TOUCH,feel,I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed.,4019,4249
3,TOUCH,feel,"Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in words.",11755,11932
3,TOUCH,grate,"Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty for me was synonymous with degradation.",13158,13466
4,TOUCH,feel,"Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.",747,1013
4,TOUCH,cold,"“What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend.",2738,2960
4,TOUCH,feel,I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast.,3431,3511
4,TOUCH,cold,"I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.",4939,5256
4,TOUCH,sensation,"It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation.",5490,5624
4,TOUCH,brush,"You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?” I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.",10661,11185
4,TOUCH,handle,"I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.",12008,12126
4,TOUCH,handle,"The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.",12200,12515
4,TOUCH,hold,"“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?” Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a contrary opinion: I was silent.",13353,13501
4,TOUCH,touch,"I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself.",16197,16428
4,TOUCH,feel,"Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?",17182,17620
4,TOUCH,feel,"“I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome.”",19956,20121
4,TOUCH,hold,"In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning.",21938,22085
4,TOUCH,feel,"What had just passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.",22086,22361
4,TOUCH,feel,"Because it is the truth Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.",24722,24874
4,TOUCH,tremble,Why do you tremble so violently?,25246,25278
4,TOUCH,feel,"First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses.",26320,26452
4,TOUCH,chill,"A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.",26453,26659
4,TOUCH,sensation,"Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.",27048,27252
4,TOUCH,embrace,"Bessie stooped; we mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.",31725,31814
5,TOUCH,press,"Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.",557,920
5,TOUCH,chill,Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive.,1780,1866
5,TOUCH,feel,"Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie’s fireside chronicles.",3603,3832
5,TOUCH,feel,"At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the “stony street” of L——. The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.",3833,4410
5,TOUCH,touch,"She inquired how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying, “She hoped I should be a good child,” dismissed me along with Miss Miller.",6602,6871
5,TOUCH,touch,"When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.",8789,9001
5,TOUCH,cold,"I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.",9916,10163
5,TOUCH,cold,"Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out— “Form classes!”",10164,10388
5,TOUCH,hold,"When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.",10502,10717
5,TOUCH,warmth,"The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.",19536,19814
5,TOUCH,cold,"I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.",19990,20238
5,TOUCH,feel,"I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.",21079,21211
5,TOUCH,touch,"I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.",21966,22294
6,TOUCH,shiver,"A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.",185,424
6,TOUCH,feel,"Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt ready to perish with cold.",424,528
6,TOUCH,cold,"Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt ready to perish with cold.",424,528
6,TOUCH,hold,"“Burns, I insist on your holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,” &c. &c.",2371,2476
6,TOUCH,hold,"My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd’s movements.",3303,3628
6,TOUCH,stroke,"This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs.",3926,4168
6,TOUCH,feel,"The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o’clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.",4708,5240
6,TOUCH,feel,"On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.",5240,5711
6,TOUCH,feel,"It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.”",7515,7741
6,TOUCH,feel,Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.,8273,8353
6,TOUCH,feel,"If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse.",11941,12159
6,TOUCH,feel,"“But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly.",12430,12579
6,TOUCH,feel,"It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.” “Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised nations disown it.”",12580,12800
6,TOUCH,hold,"It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.” “Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised nations disown it.”",12580,12800
6,TOUCH,feel,"Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.",13437,13522
6,TOUCH,hold,"No; I cannot believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.",14891,15138
7,TOUCH,cold,"Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning.",565,972
7,TOUCH,press,"From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.",1127,1343
7,TOUCH,cold,"We set out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed.",1766,1866
7,TOUCH,cold,"It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.",1867,2049
7,TOUCH,feel,"Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.",11446,11777
7,TOUCH,hold,"To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst.",13904,14337
7,TOUCH,feel,"“Ladies,” said he, turning to his family, “Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?” Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin.",15717,15921
7,TOUCH,feel,"A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.",16257,16429
7,TOUCH,sensation,"What my sensations were, no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes.",18775,18962
7,TOUCH,sensation,What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!,18999,19056
8,TOUCH,feel,"“Come, eat something,” she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.",1387,1527
8,TOUCH,embrace,"She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.",1654,1805
8,TOUCH,feel,"I felt the impression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.",4763,5003
8,TOUCH,feel,"Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me.",7445,7560
8,TOUCH,clutch,"In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.",7560,8000
8,TOUCH,hold,"Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?",12021,12143
8,TOUCH,embrace,"no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart— “God bless you, my children!”",12996,13123
8,TOUCH,hold,Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.,13123,13335
9,TOUCH,chill,"How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!",1298,1606
9,TOUCH,cold,Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time.,3137,3285
9,TOUCH,cold,"Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.",5468,5842
9,TOUCH,feel,"True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated my heart.",7285,7568
9,TOUCH,feel,"And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos.",9814,10259
9,TOUCH,embrace,"I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,—I must embrace her before she died,—I must give her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word.",12318,12485
9,TOUCH,cold,"I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of old.",14086,14239
9,TOUCH,cold,"I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of old.",14086,14239
9,TOUCH,clasp,And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my face hidden on her neck.,16463,16615
9,TOUCH,feel,And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my face hidden on her neck.,16463,16615
9,TOUCH,feel,"That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don’t leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me.”",16682,16815
9,TOUCH,hold,When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I was in somebody’s arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory.,17011,17187
10,TOUCH,feel,"I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.",3982,4539
10,TOUCH,sensation,"My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.",4724,5050
10,TOUCH,feel,And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon.,6175,6269
10,TOUCH,feel,It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts.,8701,8855
10,TOUCH,shiver,"Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.",8856,9007
10,TOUCH,cold,"Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.",8856,9007
10,TOUCH,feel,"This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.",9678,9822
10,TOUCH,hold,"“She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music” (in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive).",10252,10485
10,TOUCH,hold,"At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J.E. “Is there only one?”",12028,12245
10,TOUCH,feel,I now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.,13997,14081
10,TOUCH,brush,"Millcote, ——shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.",14379,14494
10,TOUCH,brush,"I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.",17041,17255
10,TOUCH,embrace,In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: “Bessie! Bessie!,18285,18364
10,TOUCH,feel,"I smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.",20985,21260
